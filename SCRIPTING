Scripting
==============================================================================

In the location for scripts, usually ~/.config/antfs-cli/XXXXX/scripts
(but see README, for more precise location) you can add executable scripts
and programs.

The scripts and programs placed here will be executed in the background when
a file have been downloaded, uploaded or deleted.

The three arguments to the executables are:

 - Action (DOWNLOAD, UPLOAD or DELETE -- depending on what action caused the
   script to run)

 - File name 

 - FIT type (e.g. 4 for an Activity, see File.Identifier in ant/fs/file.py
   for other FIT file types)

Note: Do not modify, delete, or rename the original file. If you want to
modify or change the file, create a copy, or write the new data to a different
file.

Example
---------------------

    #!/usr/bin/python

    import sys

    def upload(action, filename, fittype):
        # if we downloaded a new activity
        if action == "DOWNLOAD" and fittype == 4:
            data = open(filename, 'b').read()
            # upload file
            pass

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        upload(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], int(sys.argv[3]))
